This project involves the creation of a Twitter bot named "Harry Potter", designed to automatically respond to specific pre-defined questions on Twitter. The bot operates through a Twitter account created for this purpose and is built using HTML, CSS, and Java.

The primary function of the bot is to monitor tweets that mention or reply to its account, and respond only to a select set of questions that have been hardcoded into the bot's logic. If the incoming message matches one of these questions exactly, the bot replies with a corresponding pre-programmed answer. If not, it remains silent.
